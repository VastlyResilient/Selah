VERSE BY NEED
Scripture for This Moment
Selah is rooted in the full counsel of Scripture and shaped by generations of faithful preaching and theological study. It reasons within the redemptive narrative of creation, fall, and restoration — engaging life through themes of repentance, perseverance, sanctification, and hope in Christ.  In a world shaped by digital influence, Selah uses technology to contend for clarity, not distortion — affirming God's design rather than redefining it.  Its responses are grounded solely in Scripture, free from ideological agendas, and aimed at deepening the user's understanding of biblical truth.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING THROUGH TODAY?

Whatever you are carrying today, you do not have to carry it alone.

Share what is on your heart and a scripture will meet you right where you are.
FEATURE 03
Text to Switch Your Theme

COMMON QUESTIONS
Anything on your mind?
Will I get charged? +
No. Selah operates on a completely free model for users. Faith, encouragement, and access to scripture should never sit behind a paywall.
What if I want to edit my scripture topic? +
No stress. Simply text Selah "Change to…" followed by your new category, and your daily verses will adjust immediately. We believe spiritual growth should be simple, not complicated.
What's the point? +
Look around you. Everything has a creator.

The device you are reading this on. The clothes you are wearing. The smallest object in your hand.

Nothing in this world exists by accident. In the same way, you are not an accident.

There is a God who deeply loves and cares for you. Selah exists to create a daily pause — a reminder that beyond the noise, the scrolling, and the constant notifications, there is something greater than what the eye can see.

Sometimes all we need is one verse to reset our perspective.
Can I request features or changes? +
Absolutely. Selah is built on growth, humility, and serving others first. If there is something reasonable you would like to see added, do not hesitate to share it.

If you have an idea for a Bible based tool or feature, we are open to building based on community requests.

It will remain free. Because the mission is impact, not profit.
